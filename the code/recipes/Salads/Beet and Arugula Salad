INGREDIENTS
2 pounds beets, trimmed
4 small garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste 
1/2 pound arugula
1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese, thinly sliced
16 pitted kalamata olives
1/4 cup olive oil, divided 

DIRECTIONS
1. Place beets into a large saucepan and pour in enough water to cover the beets by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beets are easily pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain and let cool.
2. Peel beets, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices, and cut slices in half. Place into a bowl.
3. Smash garlic with salt in a small bowl using a spoon until the mixture becomes a paste. Stir lemon juice into garlic paste. Retain about 1 tablespoon lemon dressing in a small bowl and pour the remaining lemon dressing over beets; toss to coat.
4. Divide arugula between 4 plates; top each plate with beets, feta cheese, and olives; drizzle salads with olive oil and retained lemon dressing.
